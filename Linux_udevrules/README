Problems with Linux (Ubuntu and others):
========================================

To reduce the initial delay after connecting USB you need to exclude the virtual com port from "modemmanager" to check it as a modem.
Also you want to grant currently logged in users access to the tty device so you don't have to use sudo to flash a microcontroller.

Copy the udev rule file "70-stm32vcp.rules" to "/etc/udev/rules.d" and reload udev manager with "udevadm control --reload"

Or just use the following command:

sudo bash -c 'cp 70-stm32vcp.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ ; udevadm control --reload'
