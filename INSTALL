Driver for older Windows versions:
==================================
On Windows 7,8,10 Windows should find the correct STM32 virtual comport driver automatically (online).
If have problems installing the driver on older Windows versions (XP, VistaÂ®, 7, and 8.x) you 
can point to the folder "WindowsSTM32VCPDriver" when asked for the driver. It contains the required .inf and
the corresponding Microsoft signed .cat file. You also can download an installer for the driver from ST website:
https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html

Linux:
======
make all

Problems with Linux distributions (Ubuntu and others):
======================================================

To reduce the initial delay after connecting USB you need to exclude the virtual com port from "modemmanager" to check it as a modem.
You can do this by the following command:

sudo bash -c 'cp Linux_udevrules/70-stm32vcp.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ ; udevadm control --reload'

      --noverify             Skip verify after write
      --nocalibrate          Skip calibration after write.
  -n, --icname=NAME          IC name, e.g. PFS154
      --noblankchk           Skip blank check before write
      --noerase              Skip erase before write
  -p, --port=PORT            COM port of programmer. Default: Auto search
  -r, --runvdd=VDD           Voltage for running the IC. Default: 5.0
      --securefill           Fill unused space with 0 (NOP) to prevent readout
  -v, --verbose              Verbose output
  -?, --help                 Give this help list
      --usage                Give a short usage message
  -V, --version              Print program version


Examples:

list all supported ICs:
  easypdkprog list

probe IC in socket (can determine IC type/name):
  easypdkprog probe

read IC to readout.hex file:
  easypdkprog -n PFS154 read readout.hex

read IC to readout.bin file:
  easypdkprog -n PFS154 read readout.hex -b

write IC:
  easypdkprog -n PFS154 write myprog.hex

erase IC (flash based only):
  easypdkprog -n PFS154 erase

start IC in socket (interactive mode):
 all serial output sent form IC-PA.7 (autobaud detection) is displayed on screen
 all input from keyboard is sent as serial to IC-PA.0 (using same detected baud as receive)
 
  easypdkprog start
